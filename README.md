NodeJS Battleship

DESCRIPTION: Play against the computer in a race to destroy the evil Imperial Navy before it destroys yours!

HOW TO PLAY: 

PURPOSE: With this project I really wanted to master the art of building constructors and using node modules. Bonus points if a fun and entertaining game happened to come out of it.
